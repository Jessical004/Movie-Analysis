# Movie-Analysis
A TMDB movie dataset with independent questions posed on different outcomes 
The TMDB movie dataset is a collection of unclean data. The data wrangling was a pretty tricky and time consuming with so much zero's while checking the data statistics. The data has only one duplicated value with major zero in budget and revenue columns respectively.I had to drop the NULL values because their size doesn't affect the dataset but couldn't drop the zero valued data points of budget, revenue and runtime because it has positive impact in the overall dataset. To drop them means losing half of the data points collected. Instead, I filtered out the data points with zero values for both budget and revenue columns and filled them with the mean. To make the distribution seam and easy, I computed the mean of budget, revenue and runtime columns for each release_year, and filled the data points with their respective release_year. Most data with the budget values of zeros got dropped because they had no revenue values.
